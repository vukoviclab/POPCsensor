01_structure.sh takes 3 arguments to making the POPC-SWNT conjugate.</br>
First argument = SWNT pdb file (It needs to make the pdb file with the VMD software)</br>
Second argument = the number of POPCs along the SWNT</br>
Third argument = the starting point of POPC
Fourth argument = the distance between POPC mass center and the SWNT.
*All file should be in the same folder and the script will work with bash version 4 only*
